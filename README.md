# rewrite-uni-code
Take coding projects that I did in university, and re-write them given what I know now.

## zip

The 2018 Operating Systems class introduced students to C programming by having the write some basic UNIX utilities.

The objective was to write a `zip` utility to compress an ASCII encoded file using [Run-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding).
