# rewrite-uni-code
Take coding projects that I did in university, and re-write them given what I know now.

## zip and pzip

Write a `zip` utility to compress an ASCII encoded file using [Run Length Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding).

[See README to see how I improved on the original]().
`zip` project specification: https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/initial-utilities
`pzip` specification: TBD
